Vanilla 1.12 addon that shows how to add more programmable buttons to your screen.

Target audience: people learning to make addons.

The game saves the layout automatically based on the button names.

It's 1 line of code to add another button - see how createbtn() is used.
Then as little as 4-5 more to make it do things - see btncallback().
